This is my project Exam marking the end of my first year at Noroff. The task was to create a blog site with essential pages like 
- Home
- About
- List of Blog Posts
- Blog Post Specific
- Contact. 

## Description
The project involved Adobe XD for design, HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript for website development.

Functionality that had to be implemented in the project: 
- A carousel for the latest posts on the Home page 
- Using the WordPress REST API, the Blog page displays the first 10 blogs with an option to load more.
- The Blog Specific page dynamically presents content based on user selection.
- I implemented a modal for image enlargements in the Blog Specific page.
- I used JavaScript for form validation on the Contact page.  

As I continue to learn JavaScript I will improve the site accordingly.

### Programs used to deliver end product:
- Adobe XD
- Visual studio Code
- Wordpress
- Headless Plugin
- Hotjar
